<h1>Pokemon Pokedex App</h1>

View deployment https://farmeroy.github.io/pokemon-pokedex/


This is a simple app that fetches JSON data from a rest API and renders with UI elements.

* You can click on the names of the pokemon to see more information as well as an image of the pokemon.
* You can scroll through the images of the pokemon in the detailed modal views. 
* You can also search for a specific pokemon in the search field. 

This data is fetched from [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/). 

Basic styling is done with Bootstrap 4 (with additional custom CSS styling).
The code is written in Javascript ES6 and linted with ESLint. 

Fetch and Promise pollyfills are used for cross-browser support.

The background image is from [PCGames](https://www.pcgamesn.com/pokemon-pc-game).
