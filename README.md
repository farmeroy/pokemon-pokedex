#Pokemon Pokedex App

This app is styled with Bootstrap and custom styles, with some some vanilla javaScript to boot.
You can click on the names of the pokemon to see more information as well as a photo of the pokemon.
You can scroll through the images of the pokemon in the detailed modal views. 
You can also search for a specific pokemon in the search field.
